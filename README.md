### Trevor D Douty
I am a team player and always ready for a challenge. Pursuing my bachelors degree in biology at Northwest Nazarene University gave me the analytical skills needed to be able to approach a large problem and find a step by step approach to a solution. Attending Boise CodeWorks has opened my eyes to the world of software development where I have found a love and passion for development.
